- If this project issues a warning, try to understand why it occurred, and decide if this is a valid behavior, or if this is a mistake
- Some of the tests rely on our personal interpretation of the subject. It is likely we got some of them wrong, if we report an error, make sure it is an error, and cannot be anything else
